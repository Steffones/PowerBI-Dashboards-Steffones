## Problem Statement

Domain: FMCG Function: Sales / Promotions

AtliQ Mart is a hypothetical retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

Sales director Bruce Haryali wanted this immediately but the analytics manager Tony is engaged on another critical project. Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes to Peter to support his work. Peter pawned off this dashboard cretaion task to steffones.

This dashboard helps sales director  to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that he can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.
